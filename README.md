#Dashi dashboard engine 0.0.1-alpha
========================

## Goal
Inspired by https://panic.com/statusboard/ the idea is to create an user friendly and central managable dashboard system. To have a high acceptance factor, the idea is to create a very userfriendly and simple to use system.

Dashi itself will only provide the Frame for widgets to run. Therefore every widget will be a Symfony2 bundle and independent.

A few technologies are predefined:
 - Nodejs for life data like graphs
 - JQuery

Minimum Requirement for Dashiclients:
- HTML5

## Installation
1. Clone project
2. Install Vagrant & Puppet
3. call `vagrant up` in root path and there you go you have a up and running working environment
